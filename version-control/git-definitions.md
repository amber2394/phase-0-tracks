# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is keeping multiple code files from the same project organized so a programmer can access previous versions of their code. It is useful because if a merge is completed and it happens to break something within the code, the developer can go back before the merge and figure out what caused the code to break.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a breakaway from the master that allows a developer to change code without effecting the master code base. You would use a branch to edit code or add code without altering the master code base.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a record of changes to the repository. A good commit message is one that is related to the code in which you changed. A good commit message has to be relevant to the change in code.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when there is some sort of problem when attempting to merge or pull from a branch.
